# Base template for all Travis jobs. The language variable can be overridden in
# derived templates or leaf files. No env, addons, script, or anything is
# defined in this template, because there is currently nothing that needs to be
# done on every single build.

# This probably shouldn't be overridden.

# Only clone a single revision by default. This has the desirable result that
# adding commits while a previous commit is in the Travis queue will make Travis
# not build the previously queued build.
