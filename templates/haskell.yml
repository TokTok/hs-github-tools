inherits: base

# Every Haskell leaf file needs to specify the package name and version. This
# information is used in after_script to tell hpc-coveralls where to look for
# the coverage data. A value of '???' is treated as an error in expansions. This
# allows base packages to document the existence and requirement of certain
# parameters while still forcing leaf files to actually define them rather than
# having them be empty.
package:
  name: '???'
  version: '???'

# We have two separate cabal/ghc directories. The 'build' cabal is the one used
# for the package being built as well as any user-provided cabal packages. The
# 'tools' cabal is used for hpc-coveralls, stylish-haskell, and hlint. We keep
# these separate because they have complicated dependencies that can (and
# sometimes do) interfere with the actual user package we want to test. In the
# future we may want to share the -tools directories across all repositories,
# because they are going to end up being identical.
